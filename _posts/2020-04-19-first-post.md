  Welcome to my website and blog. I created this website primarily to display my software projects.
  I started coding as a Freshman in college, which was already over a year ago... time flies! I started by taking an introductory programming
  course offered by the Computer Science department at my school: The University of Minnesota. I enjoyed this class so much
  that I am now a Computer Science major, almost done with my core classes, and getting ready to take the elective classes that will
  determine my upper division major track. I have learned a lot about many fundamental topics
  in the Computer Science realm including: algorithms, software development methods and patterns, multiple programming languages, statistics, linear algebra, and more. This website will display the projects I have created with this knowledge. For the blog portion of this site
  I will include tech tutorials, my thoughts on being a student, and information for people who are interested in learning more about
  the fascinating and rewarding world of Computer Science.
