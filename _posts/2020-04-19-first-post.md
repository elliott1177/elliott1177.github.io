title: First Post
---

    This is the inaugural post of my blog. It's currently 2:30AM and I've been
  working on getting this site configured and set up for hours. As a Computer
  Science student I never learned web development in any of my classes. I always
  worried about the front end aspect of it, I'm not great at visual aesthetics
  but I always felt like using a theme was cheating. As someone who studies
  computers I felt like I should build a site from scratch. I ended up somewhere
  in the middle. Starting off this website will be hosted using github-pages
  under the default URL (elliott1177.github.io), perhaps I'll get a custom URL
  in the future. This site is built using a static site generator called jekyll. I am using a theme called minimal mistakes that I found on Github. It was developed by Michael Rose and can be found [here](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). I will make my own additions to the layout of this website, the theme is just a starting point. My goal is to host my project portfolio on this website and to keep this blog updated regularly with tutorials (maybe on how to build a site like this) and various things I find interesting in the realm of Computer Science.
