title: "How I built this website"

To create my blog I had a few options. I could've payed for a WordPress website,
which is a great option for most people and in my experience is very easy to use. Especially when purchasing a pre-made theme.

As a Computer Science student I never learned web development in any of my classes. I always
worried about the front end aspect of it, I'm not great at visual aesthetics
but I always felt like using a theme was cheating. As someone who studies
computers I felt like I should build a site from scratch. I ended up somewhere
in the middle. Starting off this website will be hosted using github-pages
under the default URL (elliott1177.github.io), perhaps I'll get a custom URL
in the future. This site is built using a static site generator called jekyll.
I am using a theme called minimal mistakes that I found on Github. It was
developed by Michael Rose and can be found [here](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).
I will make my own additions to the layout of this website, the theme is
just a starting point. My goal is to host my project portfolio on this website
and to keep this blog updated regularly with tutorials (maybe on how to build
a site like this) and various things I find interesting in the realm of
Computer Science.
