- I wrote this script for a client who wanted to increase the efficiency of importing Shopify sales data into QuickBooks.
- Before, a monotonous process was required when adding a new product to the Shopify store.
- They had to add the new product to their FileMaker database.
- The inefficient part was the need to add the many variations of the product (coffee) based on grind type.
- This script automates the process.
- Now, if a new type of coffee is added to the store, the medium, coarse, fine, etc. grind is automatically added.
