I wrote this script for a client who wanted to increase the efficiency of
importing Shopify sales data into QuickBooks. Before, every time a new product was
added to the store, they would need to update the FileMaker database with not just the product, but an item for
every single product variation. This script automates the process. Now, if a new type of coffee is added to the store, the medium, coarse, fine, etc. grind is automatically added.
